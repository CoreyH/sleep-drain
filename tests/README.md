# tests: hardware-free checks

Each runs as `python3 -I -B tests/<name>.py` and prints one line per check. What each one covers (the list that
used to sit in CLAUDE.md, entry for entry):

- `python3 -I tests/pmu_alarm_test.py` runs `pmu-alarm`'s real test against a fake PMU.
- `tests/rtc_alarm_load_test.py` runs `rtc-alarm-test/load` as root in a bubblewrap sandbox against a fake
  /sys, with one failure injected per case.
- `tests/rtc_alarm_check_test.py` runs `rtc-alarm-test/check` the same way against a stub rtcwake.
- `tests/e1_hook_check_test.py` runs `e1-hook/check` the same way against a fake kernel that plays both runs,
  and `tests/e1_hook_verdict_test.py` runs `e1-hook/verdict` on made-up captures, one fault per case.
- `tests/sleep_drain_valid_test.py` runs `sleep-drain-log`'s resume summary (drain and validity) on recorded
  snapshots.
- `tests/peek_decoders_test.py` checks `pmgr-map` and `smc-keys` on synthetic input, and `pmgr-map` on this
  Mac's ADT dump when it's there.
- `tests/safe_boot_hook_test.py` runs the safe boot's initramfs hook in mkinitcpio's busybox ash, in a
  bubblewrap sandbox with stub mount and blockdev, one failure per case.
- `tests/safe_boot_save_test.py` runs `sleep-drain-safe save` in a fake safe boot and `collect` in a fake next
  boot.
- `tests/m1_crumbs_test.py` runs `e1-hook/m1-crumbs` on a fake PMU nvmem file, position=1's samples made by
  compiling `e1-hook/m1_position.h` itself, and cluster_ack=1's three values and its waits by compiling
  `e1_hook.c`'s own table and wait functions.
- `tests/recfg_peek_test.py` runs `e1-hook/recfg_peek` on a sparse file standing in for /dev/mem and its
  launcher with stubs.
- `tests/recfg_bite_test.py` runs `e1-hook/recfg_poke` on the same kind of file (exactly one word changes, or
  none; the store is 64 bits) and `e1-hook/recfg-bite` with stubs.
- `tests/wd2_bite_test.py` runs `e1-hook/wd2_poke` that way too (one word changes, or none; its store is 32
  bits) and `e1-hook/wd2-bite` with stubs.
- `tests/sleep_drain_reading_test.py` runs `sleep-drain-reading` as uid 0 in a bubblewrap user namespace
  against a fake battery, with stub `sleep-drain-safe` and `systemctl`.
